The total size of all "small" requests for each trace. We use five 
different policies to define small requests: the maximum size may be 4 KB,
8 KB, 16 KB, 32 KB or 64 KB. 
There is a large burst in activity in T7, as in the first two graphs;
requests of 16-64 KB can account for most of the burst in total I/O.

We can take away two key points from these graphs. 
First of all, we can see that small I/Os of one size tend to dominate, but
which size is workload dependent.
Secondly, we can see that relatively small I/Os frequently account for 
large spikes in overall disk activity.
