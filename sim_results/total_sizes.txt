The cumulative size of all I/O requests, for each trace.
Total I/O size ranges from over 2 TB (for T1, the Live Maps trace) 
to under 20 GB (for T9, the Radius Authentication server). 
T1 is fairly bursty and a few other graphs exhibit large spikes
in disk activity; T4, a mail server, spikes at around 13 hours due to 
a large server replication event, and T7, the Windows build server, is
most active between hours 4 and 8. However, most traces show a fairly 
steady rate of disk activity. Traces 11 and 12, the database benchmarks,
show far more activity than any of the production servers.
