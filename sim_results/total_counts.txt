The cumulative number of I/O requests, for each trace. In this context,
a sequence of exactly sequential requests is consolidated into a single
request. 
In most cases, the number of I/O requests and size of I/O requests from
the previous graph show similar patterns. 
However, note that T1 has a much larger cumulative I/O size than 
any other trace, but a similar number of I/O requests, suggesting that it
mostly serves large, sequential requests. T1, the Live Maps server, 
retrieves map image tiles; 
it typically reads entire large image files at once.
