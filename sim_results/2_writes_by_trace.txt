The total size of all small writes for each trace.
The size of small writes in T9 and T10 is modest. 
Assuming shelters are cleaned every 5 minutes and all writes smaller than 32 KB
are sheltered, all writes in T7, T8, T9 and T10 could be sheltered in a little
over 1 GB. For both T7 and T8, using a 32 KB policy significantly reduces 
memory requirements, although a 64 KB policy would still be feasible.
T11 would impose unreasonable memory demands of almost 40 GB, and T12 would
require 5-10 GB. 

In short, pinning sheltered writes would require fairly little memory, except
for T11 and T12.

(All estimates of memory requirements are very rough, back-of-the-envelope
calculations.)
