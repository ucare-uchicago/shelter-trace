The total size of all small writes for each trace.
In many cases, including T1, T2, T3, and T5, small writes amount to only
a few gigabytes of data, regardless of policy. 
If shelters were cleaned every five minutes, and all writes smaller than 64 KB
were sheltered, none of these traces would require more than 1 GB to 
accomodate sheltered data.
